Meta Table Builder (low prio):
 - concatenate traits and delegate towards the build method

Type Traits:
 - cleanup (only support value and pointer-to-pointer and const correctness)

Operators:
 - concat, call
 - pow
 - const correctness

Old API pending:
 - multi return (table, function, script)
 - regain table speed
 - regain property speed
 - try avoid moving and pass as reference
